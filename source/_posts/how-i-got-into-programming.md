Back in the early 2000's when Myspace was the popular social network, I remember going to other people's pages and was amazed by their custom themes. I thought to myself that I wanted to learn how to do it. After Google searching and some trial and error, I started learning about HTML.

Around this time, I also signed up for Geocities because I wanted a place where I could have more control over my website. I was still teaching myself HTML and CSS through reading tutorials and trying things on my own. I was also getting into designing a site in Photoshop to slice it up to then turn into HTML.

After a while, I decided to leave Geocities and ended up bouncing around between several of the free shared hosting providers. Some of them didn't have any kind of control panel and the only way to upload a site was through FTP. I tended to switch quite often because I didn't like how most of them injected ads into my site. I eventually moved over to a paid hosting provider.

After high school, I went to college and studied Interactive Media where I learning video editing, 3D modeling, and compositing. After college, I moved back home without an idea of what I really wanted to do. I really enjoyed video production, but in the back of my mind I knew it would be easier for me to find a job doing web design. Eventually, I found a job as a web designer at EDB Solutions. We made websites for small businesses located nationwide.

A couple of years later, I moved up to New York City and got an internship at CourseHorse. In the beginning, I was creating and updating the newsletter that went out twice a week. After sometime, I asked the lead developer if I could start fixing front-end issues since I was stronger in HTML and CSS by that point. He agreed and that's when I started learning more in depth about PHP and MVC frameworks. Later, he came up with the idea of teaching me more about backend development.

Since then, I have kept pushing myself to learning new things and getting better.
